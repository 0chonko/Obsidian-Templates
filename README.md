# Obsidian-Templates for Zettelkasten
A repository containing templates and scripts for #Obsidian to support the #Zettelkasten method for note-taking.

## Obsidian
Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management app on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It lets you turn a collection of plain text files into a rich network of linked thought.

## Zettelkasten
A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.
